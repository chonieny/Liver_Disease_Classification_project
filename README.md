# Liver Disease Predictor: Project Overview 

* **Objective**<br/> 
This project aims to build an optimal classification machine learning model to accurately predict whether patients will develop liver-associated disease. Being one of the most common causes of death worldwide, liver disease is responsible for nearly 2 million deaths per year, and the number is growing every year. Thus, being able to accurately predict whether someone might have liver disease is not only beneficial but crucial, especially for ones who have comorbidities.
